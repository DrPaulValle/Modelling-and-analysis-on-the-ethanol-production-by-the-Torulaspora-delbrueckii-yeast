# Modelling-and-analysis-on-the-ethanol-production-by-the-Torulaspora-delbrueckii-yeast
This work presents two mechanistic models composed of first-order nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These systems describe the evolution of alcoholic fermentation (ethanol production) by Torulaspora delbrueckii yeast when glucose and fructose are used as substrates.
